The Venom Language

The Venom programming language is simple enough that beginners will see results quickly, but powerful enough to write sophisticated control systems.
Work quickly
Venom allows an engineer to create a working control system in a very short time. There are three powerful features that support this:
Venom has a built-in library of Driver Objects that handle everything from Digital I/O ports to Graphics LCDs. All you have to do is tell these tried-and-trusted objects what to do.
The VenomIDE programming environment provides powerful code development tools, such as syntax highlighting, error-location and interactive help.
Venom has a very fast 'edit-compile-debug' cycle: small changes to your code will download and run in less than a second.


This Files allows you to have highlighted text for VENOM language in Notepad ++

I will be working on the Auto complete feature.
